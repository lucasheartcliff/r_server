# Rust_Server

## Description

Rust_Server is a simple server project developed as part of a Udemy course on Rust programming language. It provides a lightweight and efficient framework for building server-side applications in Rust.

## Features

- **Efficiency**: Utilizes Rust's strong concurrency model for high-performance server applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for scalable applications.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a modular design that allows easy extension and customization according to project requirements.
- **Safety**: Leverages Rust's ownership system and strong type checking to ensure memory safety and prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
4. Run `cargo build` to build the project.
5. After successful compilation, execute `cargo run` to start the server.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, it will be listening for incoming connections on the specified port. You can then interact with the server using HTTP requests or any other protocol implemented by the server.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```
